# Ubuntu WSL

Benefit from the unrivalled developer experience of Ubuntu without leaving
Windows.

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment
on Windows. The Ubuntu distribution for WSL is tightly integrated with the
Windows OS, supporting remote development from popular IDEs, cross-OS file
management and seamless local testing of web applications. Ubuntu WSL provides
a high-quality command line interface that is also suitable for launching
Linux-native graphical applications.

Ubuntu WSL can be used to build projects in a performant Linux environment
without the overhead of traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setups.
Organisations that manage a Microsoft infrastructure can empower developers who
prefer a Linux-based workflow. With [Ubuntu Pro for WSL](explanations/up4w), large
fleets of Ubuntu WSL machines can also be administered with ease and security.

Ubuntu WSL is for the programmer who wants a fully-featured Linux development
environment but must use a Windows device, the system administrator who
requires a secure way of supporting Linux on hundreds of Windows machines, and
the cross-platform app developer who needs to create projects that work on
Linux, Windows and the browser.
