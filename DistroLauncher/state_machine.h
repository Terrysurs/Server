     * This state machine implementation builds on the value semantics of std::variant sum type instead of inheritance
     * hierarchies as commonly practiced in object oriented languages.
     * The template mechanisms above just make a bit easier implementing pattern matching visitation of a variant based
     * on the underlying types and compile-time checking of types in the context of std::variant instantiation.
     *
     * In this state machine the state transition logic is implemented in the state classes. Thus, this is a generic
     * component which just connects the pieces, the business logic must be implemented somewhere else, being a subclass
     * or a controller class which has one instance of this. They must provide a member function `ExpectedState
     * on_event(Events event)` which matches against the Events variant returning the appropriate State. Unhandled
     * events will default to `return nonstd::make_unexpected(InvalidTransition{state_, event});`
     *
     * To effectively build upon this state machine class, some conventions must be followed (they are reinforced by the
     * template checking spread around this class):
     *
     * 1. Define an outer context class, enclosing the definition of states, events and holding the state_machine
     *    instantiation.
     * 2. Define state classes grouped in a States class (or struct) for easy discoverability (making dev life a bit
     *    easier).
     * 3. Define State as a type alias for std::variant of the state classes. The first type declared in the variant
     *    argument will be the initial state when the machine is default constructed (if that type is default
     *   constructible).
     * 4. Apply the exact same steps 2 and 3 for the events, i.e. create the struct Events{}, define the possible events
     *    inside it and define the alias `using Event = std::variant<list of all the event classes>...`.
     * 5. Instantiate a state_machine or a subclass deriving from it passing the above mentioned outer scope as a
     *    template type argument.
     *
     * Following those principles turn possible building the API shown in StateMachineTests.cpp. Refer to that file for
     * examples of usage of this state_machine. It's easier than trying to understand everything from this header file
     * only.
