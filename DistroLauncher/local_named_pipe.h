    /**
     * Encapsulates the Win32 named pipe which can be inherited by child processes into an RAII object to simplify
     * its usage. This pipe is said local in the sense that both client and server stays in the same application.
     * This is useful for situations like logging or console redirection. Server end is inbound access, i.e. it's meant
     * to be read-only while client is a write-only file. The client handle could be inherited by a child process as
     * it's stdout and the process creating the pipe could read it to display in a text component, for example.
     * The opposite is also viable, the process creating the pipe could redirect it's stdout and stderr to the write
     * handle and let a child process inherit the read handle as stdin, implementing a unix shell pipe like
     * process chain.
     *
     * CLASS INVARIANTS
     *
     * At any point in time an instance of this class must:
     *
     * Have both hWrite and writeFd valid.
     * Invalidate one of the memebers above must invalidate the other simultaneously.
     * hRead must stay valid for the whole object lifecycle.
     * szPipeName must start with \\.\pipe\
     * write end getters must always return valid handles.
     *
     * A factory function (makeNamedPipe()) is offered as a good way to create a named pipe as an expected object. Shall
     * the creation fail, the function will return a message with some context about the failure.
