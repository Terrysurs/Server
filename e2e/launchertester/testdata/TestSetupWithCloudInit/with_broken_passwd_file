# Here we'll have a /etc/passwd file with:
# - ubuntu user with UID 2000 but nologin
# - u user with UID 2001 but nologin and an extra non-sense metadata field
# - someuser with just a name and nothing else.
# - UID 1001 without a name
# - break_the_world user with UID 1002 missing fields (home and shell are not present)
# - lxd user with UID 998 which shouldn't interfere with the results
# No one of those lines are suitable for being the default user
